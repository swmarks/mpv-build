"""Content-addressed binaries for the libraries this repository builds itself.

Every push to main publishes the artifacts that commit needs, and the committed
manifest on that commit points at them, so any commit can be pinned by a
consumer and gets binaries built from exactly its sources.

The mechanism is a content key per library: the first 12 hex characters of a
sha256 over that library's pinned sources, its patch series, the build flags,
the platform group's canonical platform set, the group's build driver, and the
group's toolchain generation. Assets carry the key in their name, which makes
them immutable -- a name that already exists on the group's rolling prerelease
is the same bytes by construction, so it is never re-uploaded and never
clobbered.

Everything is scoped to a platform group (`--platform-group`, default apple):
each group has its own self-built libraries, canonical platform tuple, build
driver, toolchain file `toolchain/<group>.txt`, rolling release
`binaries-<group>`, and section under `platforms.<group>` in the repo-root
`artifacts.json` manifest. Only the apple group is active today; the code paths
are group-generic so android/linux/windows drivers plug into the same table.

Key-input text (schema 2) -- the exact bytes each key is derived from, one
line per field, `\\n`-terminated, in this order:

    schema=2
    artifact=<artifact id>           # the library the driver builds, e.g. libmpv
    component=<canonical component>  # its versions.json entry, e.g. mpv
    version=<resolved version>       # pins from versions.json components,
    url=<resolved url>               #   override-aware for the platform group
    ref=<resolved ref>               # each only when the resolved pin
    sha256=<resolved sha256>         #   carries it (git kinds have ref and,
    commit=<resolved commit>         #   once pinned, commit; archives sha256)
    gpl=<0|1>
    debug=<0|1>
    platforms=<comma-joined canonical platform tuple>
    driver=<sha256 over the group's driver sources, path + file sha256 each>
    toolchain=<sha256 of toolchain/<group>.txt>
    patch=<name>:<sha256>            # resolved patch series, one per entry,
                                     #   series order, pool-file sha256

The key is the first 12 hex characters of the sha256 of that text. The patch
series for `<component>` is `patches/<component>/series.common` followed by
`patches/<component>/series.<group>` (blank lines and `#` comments ignored,
order authoritative, a missing series file is empty), each entry naming a file
in `patches/<component>/pool/`.

Two artifact kinds per library:

  <Framework>-<key>.xcframework.zip   what Package.swift links against
  <library>-all-<key>-<platform>.zip  the thin install tree, restored by a
                                      later build instead of recompiling

Group.json-defined groups -- the android/linux/windows drivers define their
group in `platforms/<group>/group.json` instead of the in-code table (apple
stays in code):

    {
      "assetBase": ".../releases/download/binaries-<group>",
      "toolchain": "toolchain/<group>.txt",
      "driver": ["platforms/<group>/build.sh", ...],
      "artifacts": {
        "libmpv-<group>": {
          "components": ["mpv", "ffmpeg", ...],
          "variants": ["arm64-v8a", ...],
          "assetPattern": "libmpv-<group>-{key}-{variant}.tar.gz"
        }
      }
    }

Their artifacts are multi-component: one asset per variant (ABI/arch) carries
every listed component in a single build. Key-input text for a group.json
artifact (schema 2), one line per field, `\n`-terminated, in this order:

    schema=2
    artifact=<artifact id>            # e.g. libmpv-android
    component=<canonical component>   # for every component of the artifact,
    version=<resolved version>        #   in sorted canonical-name order: its
    url=<resolved url>                #   header line then its pin lines from
    ref=<resolved ref>                #   versions.json, override-aware for
    sha256=<resolved sha256>          #   the group, ref/sha256/commit each
    commit=<resolved commit>          #   only when the resolved pin has it
    variants=<comma-joined variants tuple, group.json order>
    driver=<sha256 over the group's driver files, path + file sha256 each>
    toolchain=<sha256 of the group's toolchain file bytes>
    patch=<component>/<name>:<sha256> # every component's resolved patch
                                      #   series, components in the same
                                      #   sorted order, series order within a
                                      #   component, pool-file sha256

There are no gpl=/debug= lines: every build is GPL (there is no LGPL variant to
key) and group.json builds have no flag matrix, so --debug does not move these
keys. The asset one artifact publishes per variant is assetPattern with
{key} and {variant} substituted; the pattern, including its extension, is
authoritative. record-platform renames the unkeyed `<artifact>-<variant><ext>`
(or accepts the already-keyed name), then records

    platforms.<group>.libraries.<artifact> = {
      "key": <key>,
      "prebuilt": {<variant>: {"asset": <name>, "checksum": <sha256 of the
                               asset file, verified by downstream consumers>}}
    }

in artifacts.json; unlike apple there is no merge step, so record-platform is
also the verb that writes the manifest (the publish job collects every
variant into one release dir and runs it once per variant). `verify` and
`stale` demand every variant recorded with the key's asset names; there is no
frameworks concept outside apple (record-frameworks refuses these groups) and
render is a no-op for them.

Deliberately coarse: the key hashes the group's whole build driver, so editing
any of its sources invalidates every self-built library in the group.
Under-invalidation would mean silently shipping stale binaries;
over-invalidation only costs a build. The fast path that matters is preserved:
a commit that only touches patches/mpv/* or mpv's pin in versions.json moves
mpv's key alone.
